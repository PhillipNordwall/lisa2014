This 1/2 day tutorial examines debugging tools and techniques.  It concentrates
on kernel debugging, with emphasis on tools available on SmartOS.  Tools  for
other operating systems (e.g., Linux and *BSD) are also covered.  The tutorial starts with a
description of the available tools on each of the OSes.  It then goes through several
example debugging sessions, using the tools and the source code to drill down to find
the root cause of the problems.  Developers, devops, and experienced administrators
who have encountered crashes will benefit from this tutorial.  For completeness, some
of the discussion and a lab is aimed at user level problems.   To follow along, attendees should have
access to at least a machine (can be virtualized) running SmartOS (available at
http://wiki.smartos.org/display/DOC/Download+SmartOS).  Access to Linux and FreeBSD systems will be helpful.
